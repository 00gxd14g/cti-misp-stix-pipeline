## Code of Conduct

This project adheres to a code of conduct. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Show empathy towards other community members

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/cti-misp-stix-pipeline.git
   cd cti-misp-stix-pipeline
   ```
3. **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/00gxd14g/cti-misp-stix-pipeline.git
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 or higher
- Redis server (for testing v2 features)
- uv package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Install uv** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Create virtual environment and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   uv pip install -e ".[dev,test]"
   ```

3. **Install pre-commit hooks** (recommended):
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Setting up Test Environment

1. **Start Redis** (required for v2):
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine
   ```

2. **Copy configuration files**:
   ```bash
   cp config.ini.example config.ini
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Edit configuration** with your test MISP instance details

## Contribution Guidelines

### Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and concise (< 50 lines ideally)
- Use meaningful variable names

### Code Formatting

We use automated code formatting tools:

```bash
# Format code
black .

# Sort imports
isort .

# Lint code
ruff check .

# Type checking
mypy cti_misp_taxii.py
```

### Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

Sample commit:
```
feat(stix2): Add support for STIX 2.1 Sighting objects

Implemented comprehensive sighting support including:
- Count tracking
- Confidence scoring
- Temporal information

Closes #123
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_processor.py

# Run specific test
pytest tests/test_processor.py::test_warninglist_override
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Use descriptive test names: `test_<what>_<condition>_<expected>`
- Include docstrings explaining the test purpose
- Mock external services (MISP, TAXII, Redis)
- Aim for >80% code coverage

Sample commit:
```python
def test_warninglist_override_high_confidence_actor():
    """Test that warninglist is overridden for high-confidence APT actors."""
    # Arrange
    processor = MISPProcessor(config)
    attr = create_test_attribute(value="8.8.8.8", blocked=True)
    context = create_test_context(threat_actors=["APT28"])

    # Act
    should_override, reason = processor._should_override_warninglist(attr, context)

    # Assert
    assert should_override is True
    assert "APT28" in reason
```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

3. **Keep your branch updated**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

4. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

5. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub with:
   - Clear title describing the change
   - Detailed description of what and why
   - Reference to related issues
   - Screenshots/demonstrations if applicable

6. **Address review feedback** promptly

7. **Wait for approval** from maintainers
